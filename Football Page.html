          <h3>Sir Alex Ferguson</h3>
          <p>Maldini went through the entire 90 minutes without tackling. That is an art, and he is the master of it.</p>

          <h3>Ronaldinho Gaucho</h3>
          <p>Maldini was one of the best defenders in Champions League history. But what's so impressive about him is that when he was on the ball, he didn't look like a defender, but an elegant midfielder.</p>

          <h3>Zlatan Ibrahimovic</h3>
          <p>Maldini was the best and toughest defender I ever faced. He had everything. He was a complete defender who was strong, intelligent and an excellent man marker.</p>
