# FEDAssignment1
My project is making a website about a football legend named Paolo Maldini. I came up with the idea since to me, Paolo Maldini is the greatest defender of football history and I found it was a viable idea to make a website about him not only as a footballer but as a person too.
### User Audience Intent And Purpose
The user audience intent and purpose is to learn more about Paolo Maldini be it a footballer, or a brand owner and could be a place where they could find some photos via the Gallery Page to copy.
### Who does website cater and provide value for?
It provides value to:
- People who just knew Paolo Maldini.
- People who wants to learn about Paolo Maldini.
- People who follow football.
- People who want to research on Paolo Maldini's story.
- People who need pictures of Paolo Maldini for their purposes.
- People who wants to know about Paolo Maldini brand, Sweet Years
- AC Milan fans
### What is website catering for?
- It is catering for a footballing legend that does not have a website about him on the internet.
## Design Process
I wanted to make a website about his story, his footballing achievements, along with his social media.
However, since this is a website about him as a person.
I would need to talk about him as a footballer, a person and a brand owner.
Since Maldini is good-looking, a gallery would also be great for the public to see.
At first, my sections are Home, Story, Accomplishments, Records, Extras.
After some changes here and there, I conclude to Home, Story, Football, Gallery, Sweet Years.
 ### User Stories
 - As a user, I want a navigation bar for easy access.
 - As a user, a visually appealing UI so that feels good to look at.
 - As a user, interactive content so that it is nice and fun to use.
 ### Features
 - A navigation bar for all my pages for easy navigation.
 - A description with a huge header in my homepage, to tell about him briefly.
 - three links in my homepage that link the website i find most meaningful.
 - a responsive navigation bar that allows dropdown for easy access.
 - a animated storyline that drops down, so that it is visually appealing.
 - relevant font types that suit the person and who he is.
 - responsive timeline so that it is visually appealing.
 - expandable cards upon click to show content so that it is visually appealing with the reveal function used so that upon scroll it will nicely appear.
 - reveal content upon scrolling animation.
 - responsive gallery.
 - responsive storyline.
 - linking of html and website that Maldini owns.
 ### Left Out Possible Features
 - Footer for Social Media
 - Dropdown for Records by Maldini
 ## Technologies Used
- JQuery
  - The project uses jQuery to Subresource Integrity Checking(SRI).
  - This allows browsers to ensure that resources hosted on third-party servers have not been tampered with. Use of SRI is recommended as a best-practice, whenever libraries are loaded from a third-party source.
  - [jQuery Link](https://releases.jquery.com/)
- Font Awesome 5
  - The project uses Font Awesome 5 to implement three bars for navigation bar for responsive versions.
