# FEDAssignment1
My project is making a website about a football legend named Paolo Maldini. I came up with the idea since to me, Paolo Maldini is the greatest defender of football history and I found it was a viable idea to make a website about him not only as a footballer but as a person too.
### User Audience Intent And Purpose
The user audience intent and purpose is to learn more about Paolo Maldini be it a footballer, or a brand owner and could be a place where they could find some photos via the Gallery Page to copy.
### Who does website cater and provide value for?
It provides value to:
- People who just knew Paolo Maldini.
- People who wants to learn about Paolo Maldini.
- People who follow football.
- People who want to research on Paolo Maldini's story.
- People who need pictures of Paolo Maldini for their purposes.
- People who wants to know about Paolo Maldini brand, Sweet Years
- AC Milan fans
### What is website catering for?
- It is catering for a footballing legend that does not have a website about him on the internet.
## Design Process
At first, my sections are Home, Story, Accomplishments, Records, Extras.
After some changes here and there, I conclude to Home, Story, Football, Gallery, Sweet Years.
